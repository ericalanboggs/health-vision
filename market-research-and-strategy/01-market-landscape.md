## Key Trends Shaping the Space

**AI integration is now table stakes.** 37% of 2024 digital health funding went to AI-focused startups, accelerating to 62% in 2025. Every major player has launched or announced AI features: Noom's "Avo" AI coach, Headspace's "Ebb" companion, Google's Gemini-powered Fitbit coach. Non-AI apps face commoditization pressure.

**GLP-1 medications are reshaping weight loss.** Noom Med, Found, Calibrate, and WW Clinic all offer GLP-1 access. This creates both threat (weight loss users migrating to medication pathways) and opportunity (Summit can focus on lifestyle behaviors where medication isn't applicable).

**Conversational interfaces are winning engagement.** Sunnyside's SMS-first approach, Woebot's chatbot (forms "therapeutic bonds faster than human therapists" per research), and Wysa's penguin AI all demonstrate that conversational formats drive stickier engagement than dashboard-style apps.

**Employer channel is mature but consolidating.** 76% of employees now have wellness program access. Virgin Pulse, Wellable, and Gympass dominate distribution. B2B2C remains the fastest path to scale for clinical validation plays.

## Dominant Players vs. Emerging Challengers

### Dominant (Established Moats)

- **Noom** ($3.7B valuation, 50M+ downloads): Brand recognition, psychology curriculum, but facing subscription fatigue and difficult cancellation reputation
- **Calm/Headspace** ($2-3B each): Content libraries, celebrity partnerships, B2B enterprise distribution
- **Omada/Livongo/Vida** (B2B giants): Employer channel lock-in, clinical validation, CDC recognition

### Emerging Challengers (Watch Closely)

- **Simple Life** ("Avo" AI): $100M revenue, 800K subscribers, fastest-growing AI health coach
- **Wysa** (4.9★ rating): AI + human hybrid, FDA Breakthrough designation, expanding from mental health
- **Sunnyside** (SMS-first): Validated SMS engagement model, could expand beyond alcohol

## Platform Risk Assessment

### 🔴 High Risk Areas
- Basic fitness tracking (Apple/Google have commoditized)
- Sleep tracking (native apps increasingly competitive)
- Workout logging (Apple Fitness has 28% market share)

### 🟡 Moderate Risk Areas
- Meditation (Calm/Headspace retain depth advantage over Apple)
- Nutrition tracking (platform companies adding features)
- Wearable integration dependency (HealthKit/Health Connect APIs)

### 🟢 Lower Risk Areas (Where Summit Should Focus)
- Behavior change coaching (requires human expertise + AI)
- Multi-behavior coordination (complexity deters platform companies)
- SMS-first engagement (not a platform company priority)
- Enterprise/B2B wellness (complex sales, integrations)

**Assessment:** Apple and Google are eating basic tracking but avoiding coaching complexity. Summit's SMS-first, coaching-augmented approach is defensible against platform encroachment.
