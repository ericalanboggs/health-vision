## Detailed Need Analysis

### Need 1: Multi-behavior coordination without app obsession

Users managing multiple health goals (sleep, stress, exercise, diet) currently must use multiple apps or accept shallow multi-behavior trackers. They want coaching that coordinates across behaviors without requiring constant app engagement.

Current solutions are either app-heavy (Noom requires daily engagement) or single-behavior (Sunnyside for alcohol only).

**Summit's SMS-first, multi-behavior approach directly addresses this** with the ability to check in without opening an app.

---

### Need 2: Affordable human coaching in the $30-50/month gap

A significant user segment wants human accountability but can't afford $100+/month programs. Rise ($48/mo) and Wellory ($60/mo) serve this partially but focus only on nutrition. There's no affordable multi-behavior human coaching option.

**Summit's $40/month premium tier with scheduled coaching sessions is competitively positioned** but should emphasize multi-behavior advantage over nutrition-only competitors.

---

### Need 3: SMS-primary health engagement

Users experiencing "app fatigue" want health support that doesn't require downloading another app or checking dashboards.

Sunnyside validated this need with SMS alcohol coaching ($11.5M funding, 32% behavior improvement). No competitor offers multi-behavior SMS-first coaching.

**Summit's Twilio-powered SMS experience is genuinely differentiated.**

---

### Need 4: Stress and energy habit coaching

Weight loss is saturated; meditation is crowded; but stress/energy management as a behavioral intervention (not just meditation) is underserved.

Users want concrete habits for managing stress and boosting energy, not just "meditate more."

**Summit could own this positioning** with specific stress-reduction and energy-boosting habit protocols.

---

### Need 5: AI-curated content from diverse trusted sources

Most apps create original content or offer none. Summit's approach of AI-curating YouTube recommendations matched to user friction points is unique.

**Users don't want another content library; they want personalized guidance to existing quality resources.**
