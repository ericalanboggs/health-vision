## Individual Responses

### 1. Ellen M — 4/5 | WTP: $25

- **Favorite aspect:** Weekly reflections — good cadence, concise but important questions. Recommendations and videos felt very personal and curated.
- **Aha moment:** Realized the excuses she'd been making to not use her standing desk.
- **Improvements:** Wanted to adjust habits after setting them. Gravitated toward longer activities (1hr yoga, 1hr massage) over daily micro-habits.
- **Testimonial:** *"The Summit app and program was very engaging and gave me awesome, personalized recommendations. I loved the experience!"*
- **Additional:** Regretted not using 1:1 coaching — believes personal rapport would drive engagement.

### 2. Tim A — 3/5 | WTP: $7

- **Favorite aspect:** Text reminders — even when he couldn't complete goals, they kept habits on his radar.
- **Aha moment:** Realized how little he'd been doing for physical and mental wellbeing.
- **Improvements:** Wants an in-app "reels" page with algorithmically tailored health content. Suggested avatar climbing a mountain, visual progress tracking. Notes his ADHD makes out-of-sight = out-of-mind.
- **Testimonial:** *"By taking personal information and translating that into customized goals it really reaches the individual on a personal level."*

### 3. Karin A — 5/5 | WTP: $15

- **Favorite aspect:** Intentionally sitting down to think about goals and intentions — forced her to slow down.
- **Aha moment:** The flexibility to pivot goals when circumstances changed (e.g., snowstorm).
- **Improvements:** Wanted tracking abilities earlier. Found text check-ins extremely helpful.
- **Testimonial:** *"Summit helped me slow down and identify my intention and why I wanted to create change."*

### 4. Julie Dillon — 4/5 | WTP: $10

- **Favorite aspect:** Text message accountability and tracking.
- **Aha moment:** Planning specific workouts made her more accountable.

- **Testimonial:** *"Summit helped me stay accountable to my wellness goals. It was easy to track my progress with text messaging responses."*

### 5. Mary — 5/5 | WTP: $15

- **Favorite aspect:** End-of-day text reminders for tracking + newsletter with habit completion ideas (e.g., guided meditation).
- **Aha moment:** Feels less reactive, nicer to loved ones, and more optimistic at work on hard days.

### 6. Jen from New Hampshire — 4/5 | WTP: $8

- **Favorite aspect:** Quick, straightforward initial questions that captured the important stuff. Text reminders and reflections helped her see progress.
- **Aha moment:** Recognized issues with consistent sleep and work/life boundaries. Saw how impactful even 10 minutes of a habit can be.
- **Improvements:** Didn't log into the app often. Suggests gamification — progress bar, avatar climbing a mountain, streaks, Strava-style kudos.
- **Testimonial:** *"Summit helped me see what was holding me back. It gave me the tools to kickstart my path toward a more centered and healthier life!"*
- **Additional:** *"Really excited about this for you Eric and can't wait to see where it goes!"*

### 7. Jesse Sears — 2/5 | WTP: $0

- **Favorite aspect:** Weekly reflection on where things didn't go as planned and how to course correct.
- **Aha moment:** The importance of planning — including a backup plan for when life gets in the way.
- **Improvements:** Had issues receiving reminder texts due to Verizon carrier. Wants the system to suggest backup plans when the ideal version falls apart (e.g., "I had 30 minutes to work out but now only have 10").
- **Price note:** Would look for an ad-supported version with similar features.
- **Testimonial:** *"Summit really helped me reflect on what gets in the way of me accomplishing my health goals and how to get around those perceived blockers!"*
- **Additional:** *"Eric is the best."*

### 8. AJ Govoni — 4/5 | WTP: $15

- **Favorite aspect:** AI-generated habit ideas — provided coaching and direction she needed.
- **Aha moment:** Realized she needs structure and micro-habits, but falls off quickly when life happens. Started strong then fell off after getting sick, going on vacation, and other disruptions.
- **Improvements:** Wants a community/collective aspect for accountability — group habits, check-ins, or meetups (possibly as an upgraded feature). Also suggests phased habit progression over 90-day cycles tied to longer-term vision/growth goals.
- **Testimonial:** *"Summit provided structure, easy to implement habits, and support I needed as a postpartum mom looking to revive energy and feel more connected within."*

Jesse's low rating (2/5) correlates with Verizon carrier issues blocking SMS — the core experience was undermined by a delivery problem, not the product itself. His qualitative feedback is actually positive ("Eric is the best," valued reflection and backup planning).
