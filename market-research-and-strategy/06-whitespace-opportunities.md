# Whitespace Opportunities

## Opportunity 1: SMS-first Multi-Behavior Coach

**Concept Name:** "Text Your Health Coach"

**Target User:** Busy professionals 30-45 who have tried and abandoned 3+ health apps

**Core Value Prop:** The only health coaching experience that works entirely via text—no app downloads, no dashboard checking, just human-AI coaching in your messages.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Full habit tracking, reminders, and reflections via SMS
- AI handles daily check-ins; human coach reviews weekly
- Exportable progress reports via email

**Why Incumbents Can't Copy:** Noom, Lark, and WW are app-centric with massive infrastructure investment. Pivoting to SMS-first would cannibalize their app engagement metrics and require fundamental product redesign.

**Summit Alignment:** High—this IS Summit's core value prop. Lean into it harder.

**Build Effort:** Low (already built)

## Opportunity 2: Stress and Energy Habit Program

**Concept Name:** "Energy Reset"

**Target User:** Professionals experiencing burnout, chronic fatigue, or stress-related health issues who don't want meditation apps

**Core Value Prop:** Structured 8-week program targeting energy through sleep, stress, movement, and nutrition habits—not just meditation.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Behavioral interventions (not just breathing exercises)
- Multi-behavior coordination (sleep affects stress affects energy)
- Quantifiable energy tracking (simple 1-10 daily scale)

**Why Incumbents Can't Copy:** Headspace/Calm are content-first, not behavior-first. Noom is weight-focused. No major player owns "energy."

**Summit Alignment:** High—fits multi-behavior thesis perfectly

**Build Effort:** Medium (program design, content curation)

## Opportunity 3: Coach AI Co-Pilot

**Concept Name:** "Summit for Coaches"

**Target User:** Health coaches wanting to scale beyond 1:1 while maintaining personalization

**Core Value Prop:** AI handles daily client touchpoints and content recommendations; you handle the human moments that matter.

**Key Differentiators:**
- White-label SMS engagement for coach's clients
- AI-generated session prep (client patterns, suggested focus areas)
- Automated reflection collection and theme extraction

**Why Incumbents Can't Copy:** Practice Better and Healthie are EHR-focused, not engagement-focused. Nudge Coach lacks AI. Building sophisticated AI requires different DNA.

**Summit Alignment:** Medium—requires B2B pivot but leverages existing tech

**Build Effort:** High (new customer segment, sales motion)

## Opportunity 4: SMS Health for Boomers

**Concept Name:** "Health via Text"

**Target User:** Adults 55-70 who want wellness support but struggle with app complexity

**Core Value Prop:** Health coaching that works the way you already communicate—by text message.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Zero app required (purely SMS/email)
- Larger text, simpler language, patient pacing
- Family member visibility option

**Why Incumbents Can't Copy:** Youth-focused VCs and product teams; not willing to simplify for older demographics

**Summit Alignment:** Medium—addressable with positioning, not product changes

**Build Effort:** Low (marketing and onboarding adjustments)

---

## Opportunity 5: Corporate Wellness via SMS

**Concept Name:** "Summit@Work"

**Target User:** HR leaders at companies with desk-less or field workers who can't use wellness apps during work

**Core Value Prop:** Employee wellness that reaches workers via the one tool everyone has—text messaging.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Works for non-desk workers (construction, healthcare, retail)
- No app downloads required for employee participation
- Aggregate anonymized analytics for HR

**Why Incumbents Can't Copy:** Virgin Pulse, Wellable are app-first with existing infrastructure. SMS delivery would require significant technical pivot.

**Summit Alignment:** Medium—B2B sales cycle required

**Build Effort:** High (enterprise features, compliance, sales)
