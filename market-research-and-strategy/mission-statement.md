# Mission Statement

**Summit helps motivated but inconsistent adults build lasting health habits through vision-first coaching, AI-powered text support, and human guidance when it matters most.**

## Supporting Context

- **Who we serve**: Busy professionals (30-45) managing stress, sleep, and energy who know what they should do but can't make it stick.
- **What makes us different**: We start with personal vision, not a habit list. Coaching lives in your text messages, not another app. AI handles the daily, humans handle the meaningful.
- **Why it works**: Vision creates motivation. SMS removes friction. Reflection builds durability. Affordable pricing removes the barrier.

## Conversational Explanation

**The one-liner:**
"It's a health coach that lives in your text messages."

**With the hook:**
"You know how everyone downloads health apps and stops using them? Summit skips the app — it coaches you through text, starting with what actually matters to you."

**If they ask how it works:**
"You set a health vision, pick a few habits, and get daily check-ins via text. AI handles the day-to-day, and a real coach steps in when you need it."

## Killer Offer

### The offer in one sentence
Try Summit free for 7 days. If daily text coaching doesn't change how you show up for your health, cancel anytime — no questions asked.

### Handling objections

**"Will this actually work?"**
Let the pilot speak for itself. 8 real users, 3.9/5 average rating. Here's what they said:

- *"Summit helped me slow down and identify my intention and why I wanted to create change."* — Karin A (5/5)
- *"Summit provided structure, easy to implement habits, and support I needed as a postpartum mom looking to revive energy and feel more connected within."* — AJ Govoni (4/5)
- *"Summit helped me see what was holding me back. It gave me the tools to kickstart my path toward a more centered and healthier life!"* — Jen (4/5)

**"Isn't this just another app?"**
No. Most health apps reward you for opening the app. Summit coaches you through text — you never have to log in. The daily check-ins come to you. 6 of 8 pilot participants named text reminders as their favorite feature.

**"How do I know it's worth the money?"**
Core is $12/mo — less than one coffee a week. Pilot participants independently said they'd pay ~$13/mo on average before ever seeing the price. And you get 7 days free to decide for yourself.

**"I've tried things like this before and quit."**
That's exactly who Summit is for. The vision-first approach means you start with *why* this matters to you — not a generic habit list. And when life gets in the way, weekly reflections help you adapt instead of abandon.

### Why the pricing works

| Tier | Price | What they get | Who it's for |
|------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Core | $12/mo | AI text coaching, habit tracking, weekly reflections | Self-directed — just needs the nudge |
| Plus | $49/mo | Everything in Core + human coaching check-ins | Wants guidance, not just reminders |
| Premium | $119/mo | Everything in Plus + dedicated 1:1 coaching | Wants a real coach in their corner |

- **Core at $12** is validated by pilot WTP (median $13, range $7-$25 excluding outlier)
- **7-day free trial** removes all risk — they experience the texts before paying anything
- **Cancel anytime** means the only cost of trying is 7 days of their attention

### The stack (what makes it feel like a no-brainer)
1. **Clear outcome**: Build 1-3 health habits that actually stick
2. **Proof**: Real pilot testimonials from real people
3. **Risk reversal**: 7-day free trial, cancel anytime
4. **Low price anchor**: Less than a coffee a week
5. **Differentiation**: No app to open — coaching comes to you via text
