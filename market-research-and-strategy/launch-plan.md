## Daily Social Media (ongoing from launch)

**Cadence:** 1 post/day, rotating content types

| Day | Content type | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| Mon | Habit tip | "The 10-minute rule: if you can't do 30 minutes, do 10. It still counts." |
| Tue | Pilot quote / testimonial | Karin, AJ, Jen, Julie — rotate weekly |
| Wed | Behind the scenes | Product screenshot, design decision, founder reflection |
| Thu | Health insight | Sleep, stress, energy — tied to your coaching knowledge |
| Fri | "Why Summit exists" angle | App fatigue, vision-first, SMS coaching — rotate messaging |
| Sat | Personal / authentic | Gardening, life in Amesbury, your own health journey |
| Sun | Reflection prompt | "What's one thing you did for your health this week that you're proud of?" |

**Platforms (priority order):**
1. **LinkedIn** — your strongest network, founder credibility, professional audience matches target demo
2. **Instagram** — visual brand building, habit tips, stories
3. **Reddit** — participate authentically in health/self-improvement communities

## Free/Low-Cost Distribution Channels

### Your existing networks (highest ROI)
- **AC4D / design community** — alumni, colleagues, design Slack channels
- **Gardening community** — personal connection, authentic sharing
- **Personal followers** — LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook
- **Pilot participants** — ask each to tell 2–3 people
- **Mayo Clinic health coaching network** — fellow certified coaches

### Local (Amesbury + Boston)
- Amesbury community Facebook groups
- Nextdoor (Amesbury)
- Local wellness practitioners (yoga studios, nutritionists) — offer to trade: free Summit access for a referral mention
- Community bulletin boards (libraries, co-working spaces, coffee shops)
- Boston health/wellness meetups

### Online communities (be a participant, not a marketer)
- Reddit: r/selfimprovement, r/getdisciplined, r/loseit, r/Entrepreneur
- Indie Hackers — build in public, share progress
- Product Hunt — one-time launch, prep the listing well
- Health coach communities — offer free access so they can experience it

### Content/SEO (compounds over time)
- Blog posts targeting "Noom alternative," "quit habit tracker," "health coaching by text"
- "Why I quit [app]" style posts — authentic, shareable
- Guest posts on health/wellness blogs

## What NOT to spend money on (yet)
- Paid ads (Facebook, Instagram, Google) — wait until organic channels are proven
- Podcast sponsorships — revisit at 100+ subscribers
- PR agencies or press outreach — your personal story is more compelling right now
- Fancy video production — phone videos and screenshots are fine

## When to consider spending
- If organic gets you to 50+ subscribers and you want to accelerate
- If a specific channel (e.g., LinkedIn) is clearly converting and you want to boost it
- Test with $5–10/day on one platform before committing budget
