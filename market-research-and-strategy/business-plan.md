## 1. Executive Summary

**Summit Health** is an AI-powered health coaching platform that helps busy adults build sustainable habits across stress, sleep, energy, nutrition, and exercise — combining a clean web dashboard for planning and reflection with SMS-based daily coaching that meets users where they already are.

Summit occupies a genuine whitespace in digital health: among 50+ competitors analyzed, no platform offers multi-behavior health coaching with SMS as a core engagement channel alongside a full-featured web app. The closest SMS competitor (Sunnyside, $11.5M funded) is single-behavior and alcohol-only. Summit's vision-first methodology, hybrid AI + human coaching model, and dual-channel delivery (app for depth, SMS for daily momentum) create a differentiated product in a $10.5B market growing at 12-13% CAGR.

**The product** is a 3-tier subscription ($12–$119/month) with a web app for onboarding, vision-setting, habit configuration, tracking, reflections, and a curated resource library — plus AI-driven daily SMS check-ins that keep users engaged without requiring them to open the app every day. Human coaching is available on upper tiers. A 7-day free trial lowers the barrier to entry.

**Current status:** Pre-launch, with pilot feedback completed. Product is built and functional. Target public launch is March 2026.

**Founder advantage:** Eric Boggs is a Principal Software Designer at athenahealth and Mayo Clinic-certified health coach (2024) — a rare combination of healthcare UX expertise, hands-on coding ability, and clinical coaching credentials that enables rapid, customer-responsive iteration.

**Financial targets (base case):**
- **Milestone 1:** 100 paying subscribers (~Month 7) → ~$3,000/month revenue
- **Milestone 2:** 1,000 paying subscribers (~Month 20) → ~$30,000/month revenue
- **Break-even:** ~3 paying subscribers covers fixed operating costs
- **Path to profitability:** Cash-flow positive from Month 1 in all scenarios (good/better/best), given low fixed costs and bootstrapped model
- **Primary KPI:** Average subscription length. If 60%+ retain after 3 months, double down. Below 40%, pause and investigate.

## 2. Business Purpose & Value Proposition

### Why Summit Exists

People know what they should do for their health. They don't lack information — they lack **structure, accountability, and clarity** to actually follow through. Summit is a healthy habit formation system that provides exactly that: the needed structure and support to surface core motivations, create accountability, clarify goals, and help people make real progress.

This isn't theoretical. It's what pilot participants told us.

### What Pilot Participants Said They Got From Summit

_Based on an 8-person pilot (avg rating 3.9/5, median willingness-to-pay ~$13/month)._

Across all participants, Summit delivered value in five consistent themes:

| Theme | What Participants Said |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Structure & system** | "Summit provided structure, easy to implement habits, and support I needed" (AJ). Multiple participants noted that having a system — not just willpower — made the difference. |
| **Accountability** | Every single participant called out SMS reminders as a highlight. Even when habits weren't completed, the nudges kept goals "on their radar" (Tim). Julie: "It was easy to track my progress with text messaging responses." |
| **Clarity of goals & motivation** | The why-first onboarding resonated deeply. Karin: "Summit helped me slow down and identify my intention and why I wanted to create change." Starting with values before habits felt meaningfully different from competitors. |
| **Reflection & insight** | Weekly reflections helped users see patterns they'd missed. Jesse valued "weekly reflection on where things didn't go as planned and how to course correct." Ellen found them "concise but important." |
| **Personal outcomes** | Mary became "less reactive, nicer to loved ones, and more optimistic at work on hard days." Jen "saw what was holding me back" and got "tools to kickstart my path toward a more centered and healthier life." AJ found direction as "a postpartum mom looking to revive energy and feel more connected within." |

Other words that surfaced repeatedly: **personalization, slowing down, focus on intention, tracking progress, identifying blockers, becoming more present for others.**

### Individual Pilot Analysis

#### Ellen M — Rating: 4/5 | WTP: $25/month
Ellen represents the **high-engagement, high-value user**. She loved the weekly reflections and felt the curated content recommendations were "very personal." Her aha moment — realizing the excuses she'd been making about her standing desk — shows Summit's reflection prompts surfacing blind spots. She regretted not using coaching, suggesting the value prop is believed but needs lower activation energy. Her willingness to pay ($25) is the highest in the cohort and correlates with her depth of engagement.

**Signal:** Users who engage deeply will pay more. The product challenge is driving that initial depth.

#### Tim A — Rating: 3/5 | WTP: $7/month
Tim is the **ADHD-aware, needs-it-in-his-face user**. His core insight: "out of sight = out of mind." Text reminders worked because they broke through — even when he didn't complete habits, they kept goals on his radar. He wants more visual engagement (avatar, progress tracking, algorithmically tailored content). His lower WTP reflects that the product didn't fully meet his engagement needs yet.

**Signal:** SMS is validated as the right channel for attention-challenged users. Visual progress and gamification could unlock higher engagement and WTP for this segment.

#### Karin A — Rating: 5/5 | WTP: $15/month
Karin is the **intentional, values-driven user** — Summit's ideal customer. She valued being "forced to slow down" and think about intentions before jumping to habits. Her aha moment was the flexibility to pivot goals when circumstances changed (snowstorm made outdoor goals impractical). She found text check-ins "extremely helpful."

**Signal:** The Vision Framework is a genuine differentiator. Users like Karin choose Summit specifically because it starts with "why" rather than "what."

#### Julie Dillon — Rating: 4/5 | WTP: $10/month
Julie is the **pragmatic accountability-seeker**. She valued straightforward text tracking and found that planning specific workouts made her more accountable. She wants the AI to be more proactive — suggesting meal plans, offering execution support tied to goals.

**Signal:** There's demand for Summit's AI to move from reactive (tracking responses) to proactive (suggesting next actions). This is a natural product evolution.

#### Mary — Rating: 5/5 | WTP: $15/month
Mary experienced the **deepest personal transformation** in the pilot. She reported feeling less reactive, being nicer to loved ones, and more optimistic at work on hard days. Her favorite features were end-of-day text reminders and the newsletter with habit completion ideas (e.g., guided meditations). She flagged timing refinements needed for messages.

**Signal:** When Summit works, it changes how people show up in their lives — not just their health metrics. Mary's outcome ("when putting self first, you can invest in others") is the aspirational testimonial.

#### Jen — Rating: 4/5 | WTP: $8/month
Jen is the **self-aware improver** who recognized issues with consistent sleep and work/life boundaries through the reflection process. She valued the quick, straightforward onboarding and saw how impactful even 10 minutes of a habit can be. She rarely opened the app, relying on text reminders and reflections instead. Wants gamification, visual progress, and social features.

**Signal:** Confirms the dual-channel thesis — SMS carried her engagement while the app was secondary. Gamification is a repeated request across participants.

#### Jesse Sears — Rating: 2/5 | WTP: $0/month
Jesse is the **outlier with a technical barrier** — Verizon carrier issues prevented reliable SMS delivery, which undermined the core experience. Despite this, he still valued weekly reflection and the concept of backup planning for when life interrupts. His suggestion (system-generated backup plans) aligns with the existing SMS backup plan feature.

**Signal:** SMS delivery reliability is existential. Carrier issues need monitoring and fallback options. Jesse's low rating likely reflects the broken channel more than the product's value.

#### AJ Govoni — Rating: 4/5 | WTP: $15/month
AJ is the **life-stage-driven user** seeking structure during a chaotic period (postpartum). She loved the AI-generated habit ideas for providing "coaching and direction she needed." She started strong but fell off after illness and vacation — then couldn't restart. She wants community features and phased 90-day progression tied to longer-term vision.

**Signal:** Life disruptions are the #1 churn risk. Building graceful re-engagement flows (not guilt, just "welcome back, let's adjust") is critical for retention. Her community suggestion aligns with the B2B coach enablement roadmap.

### The Problem Summit Solves

Pilot data validates three core problems:

1. **Engagement drops off fast.** The average wellness app loses 75% of users within 2 weeks. Even motivated users like AJ fall off when life interrupts. Summit's SMS channel keeps the coaching relationship alive on the days users don't open the app.
2. **A pricing gap exists.** Pilot WTP ranged $7–$25 (median ~$13). Free habit trackers offer no accountability. Personal health coaches cost $100–300+/month. Summit fills the middle ground — real coaching support at an accessible price.
3. **Single-behavior tools miss the point.** Participants' goals spanned sleep, exercise, mindfulness, nutrition, and work/life boundaries — often simultaneously. No existing tool coordinates across these as an interconnected system.

### The Solution

Summit is a healthy habit formation system that pairs a web app for planning and reflection with SMS-based daily coaching.

- **The web app** is where users set their health vision, configure habits, review tracking data, write reflections, and explore curated resources — the "thinking" side of behavior change
- **SMS handles the daily touchpoints:** reminders, check-ins, habit responses, and AI-parsed logging — the "doing" side that meets users in their existing routine
- **Human coaching steps in when it matters:** strategy sessions, barrier removal, accountability
- **The Vision Framework** gives users a reason to keep going — pilot participants consistently cited clarity of intention as what made Summit feel different

### Outcomes: What Changes for Users

| Immediate | Over Time |
|-----------|-----------|
| Structure and a system to follow | Developing resilience through disruptions |
| Accountability via daily SMS | Growing self-awareness and insight |
| Clarity of goals and motivation | Calm, confidence, and optimism |
| Personalized, curated guidance | Better presence for others (family, colleagues) |
| Space to slow down and reflect | Sustainable habits that survive real life |

### Value Proposition by Stakeholder

| Who | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Users** | Structure, accountability, and clarity to actually make progress on health goals — with a platform that keeps coaching you even on the days you don't open it |
| **The market** | First multi-behavior health coaching platform that combines a web app with SMS as a core engagement channel (blue ocean) |
| **Future investors** | Capital-efficient model (AI handles scale, humans handle value) with clear path from B2C to B2B; pilot-validated product-market fit |

## 4. Target Customers

### Primary Segments (Prioritized)

#### Segment 1: Busy Professionals, 30–45
- **Profile:** Knowledge workers managing stress, poor sleep, and low energy. High smartphone usage but burned out on apps.
- **Pain:** "I know what I should do, I just can't make it stick. I start strong with apps but stop opening them after a week."
- **Why Summit:** The web app is there when they want to plan and reflect, but daily accountability arrives via text — no need to remember to open anything. AI handles the daily nudges they can't give themselves.
- **Willingness to pay:** High. 71% of this demographic already relies on subscriptions for health services; 25% spend $101+/month on wellness.
- **Acquisition channels:** Podcast advertising (Huberman Lab, Tim Ferriss), LinkedIn content, "why I quit Noom" blog content.

#### Segment 2: App-Fatigued Wellness Seekers
- **Profile:** Have tried Noom, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, or similar. Downloaded, used for 2–6 weeks, then abandoned. Still want to improve health but distrust app-based approaches.
- **Pain:** "I've tried everything. I download the app, use it for a month, then it collects dust."
- **Why Summit:** Summit's daily engagement happens via text — so even when users stop actively opening the app, the coaching relationship continues. The web app is there for deeper work (vision, reflections, resources) but isn't required daily.
- **Willingness to pay:** Moderate to high. Already proven they'll pay for health tools; need to believe this one is different.
- **Acquisition channels:** Google/Reddit content targeting "Noom alternative," "quit MyFitnessPal," app-fatigue narratives.

#### Segment 3: Older Adults, 55–70
- **Profile:** Comfortable with texting (use it daily with family), but overwhelmed by complex apps. Often managing multiple health concerns.
- **Pain:** "I want to be healthier but these apps are confusing. I just want someone to check in on me."
- **Why Summit:** Daily interaction happens via text — the channel they're already comfortable with. The web app is clean and simple for setup and reflection, but daily engagement doesn't depend on navigating a complex interface.
- **Willingness to pay:** Moderate. More price-sensitive, but high LTV once engaged due to lower churn.
- **Acquisition channels:** Facebook ads, AARP partnerships, physician referrals, word-of-mouth from adult children.

### Segments to Deprioritize (For Now)

| Segment | Why Not Now |
|---------|-------------|
| Weight loss seekers | Oversaturated (Noom, WW, Found, Calibrate); GLP-1 disruption |
| Fitness enthusiasts | Well-served by Strava, Apple Fitness, etc. |
| Enterprise / B2B | Longer sales cycle; pursue after B2C traction at ~$1M ARR |

### Customer Archetypes (From Vision Framework Data)

Summit's onboarding identifies six coaching archetypes that shape the experience:

1. **Optimizer** — High readiness, specific barriers to overcome
2. **Restarter** — Feeling stuck or plateaued, needs momentum
3. **Performer** — Motivated by visible results and energy gains
4. **Protector** — Driven by long-term health and longevity
5. **Seeker** — Still exploring what works; needs guidance
6. **Explorer** — Open-minded, willing to experiment

## 5. Competitive Analysis Highlights

_Full analysis available in [02-competitor-analysis.md](./02-competitor-analysis.md) and [03-feature-matrix.md](./03-feature-matrix.md)._

### Landscape Summary

The digital health coaching market ($10.5B, growing to $28B+ by 2030) is fragmented across six categories:

| Category | Saturation | Key Players |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Weight loss | Oversaturated | Noom ($17–70/mo), WW, Found, Calibrate |
| Meditation / mental health | Moderate–High | Calm ($80/yr), Headspace ($70/yr), Wysa |
| Nutrition coaching | Moderate | Rise ($48/mo), Wellory ($60/mo) |
| Habit tracking | Moderate | Streaks ($5 one-time), Fabulous ($40–80/yr), Atoms ($120/yr) |
| App + SMS hybrid coaching | **Nearly empty** | Sunnyside ($99/yr, alcohol-only, no web app) |
| Multi-behavior coaching | **Underserved** | No dominant player at accessible price point |

### Summit's Competitive Position

**What makes Summit defensible:**

| Differentiator | Summit | Noom | Calm | Rise | Sunnyside |
|---------------|--------|------|------|------|-----------|
| SMS as daily engagement channel | Yes (+ web app) | No (app-only) | No (app-only) | No (app-only) | Yes (SMS-only, no web app) |
| Multi-behavior | Yes | Partial (weight-focused) | No (meditation) | No (nutrition) | No (alcohol) |
| Vision framework | Yes (proprietary) | No | No | No | No |
| AI + human hybrid | Yes | Partial | No | Yes (human only) | No |
| Price range | $12–119/mo | $17–70/mo | $80/yr | $48/mo | $99/yr |

### Why Incumbents Can't Easily Replicate

- **Noom / WW / Lark:** App-centric infrastructure; adding SMS as a core channel would cannibalize their app engagement metrics that justify investor valuations
- **Calm / Headspace:** Content-first business model; coaching and behavior change are outside their core competency
- **Rise / Wellory:** Single-behavior (nutrition only); multi-behavior coaching requires different expertise and product architecture
- **Practice Better / Healthie:** EHR/practice management focus; consumer engagement layer is an entirely different product

### Competitive Moat (In Development)

| Defensible | Easily Copied |
|-----------|---------------|
| SMS engagement templates & patterns | Basic habit tracking |
| Vision Framework methodology | YouTube API recommendations |
| AI prompt engineering for coaching | Generic AI personalization |
| Human + AI handoff workflow optimization | |
| Accumulated user behavior data | |

## 6. Marketing & Brand Strategy

### Brand Positioning

**Core message:** "Health coaching that keeps working — even on the days you don't open the app."

**Secondary messages by context:**
- *Awareness:* "The middle ground between tracking apps and expensive coaching"
- *Consideration:* "A web app for planning your health vision. Daily texts that keep you on track. Human coaching when it matters."
- *Conversion:* "Set your vision. Get daily coaching by text. Reflect when you're ready. It just works."

### Brand Personality

| Attribute | Expression |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Grounded** | We don't hype transformation. We help you build something that lasts. |
| **Direct** | We communicate simply — just like a text from a friend who cares. |
| **Confident, not loud** | We know this works. We don't need to shout about it. |
| **Human-first** | Technology serves the coaching relationship, never the other way around. |

### Positioning by Persona

| Persona | Brand Message |
|---------|--------------|
| Busy professional 30–45 | "Plan on the weekend, get coached by text all week" |
| App-fatigued seeker | "A dashboard when you want it, daily coaching by text when you don't" |
| Older adult 55–70 | "Set up once with help, then get daily health support by text" |

### Go-to-Market Strategy (Phased)

**Phase 1: Launch (Months 1–3) — Prove the channel**
- Convert pilot users to paid subscribers
- Publish 4–6 "app fatigue" content pieces (blog + social)
- Launch on Product Hunt / Indie Hackers
- Personal network outreach
- Goal: 25–40 paying subscribers

**Phase 2: Content Engine (Months 4–8) — Build organic discovery**
- Weekly blog/newsletter targeting "Noom alternative," "quit MyFitnessPal" searches
- 2–3 podcast guest appearances (health, wellness, tech)
- Reddit / community participation (r/loseit, r/getdisciplined, r/selfimprovement)
- SEO-optimized landing pages per use case (stress, sleep, energy)
- Goal: 100 paying subscribers

**Phase 3: Amplify (Months 9–12) — Paid and partnership growth**
- Targeted podcast ads (Huberman Lab, The Tim Ferriss Show — test with smaller shows first)
- Health coach partnership program (free accounts for coaches to experience the product)
- Facebook/Instagram ads targeting 55–70 demographic
- Explore referral program (give a month, get a month)
- Goal: 250+ paying subscribers

### Key Marketing Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Trial-to-paid conversion | 25–35% |
| Monthly churn (Core) | < 8% |
| Monthly churn (Plus/Premium) | < 4% |
| Customer acquisition cost (CAC) | < $30 (organic), < $60 (paid) |
| LTV:CAC ratio | > 3:1 |

---

## 7. Digital Strategy

### Online Presence

| Channel | Purpose | Cadence |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **summithealthcoaching.com** (or similar) | Primary conversion point — pricing, testimonials, signup | Always on |
| **Blog** | SEO content targeting app-fatigue, habit change, wellness keywords | 1–2 posts/month |
| **Email newsletter** | Nurture leads, share health insights, drive trial signups | Biweekly |
| **Instagram** | Visual brand building, habit tips, user stories | 3–4 posts/week |
| **LinkedIn** | Founder thought leadership on healthcare UX and behavior change | 1–2 posts/week |
| **Twitter/X** | Real-time engagement, product updates, health tech commentary | As relevant |
| **Reddit** | Community participation in health/wellness/self-improvement subreddits | Ongoing, authentic |

### SEO Strategy

**Target keyword clusters:**

| Cluster | Example Keywords | Intent |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| App alternatives | "Noom alternative," "MyFitnessPal alternative," "quit habit tracker" | High purchase intent |
| SMS health | "health coaching by text," "SMS wellness coach," "text message habit tracker" | Category creation |
| Behavior change | "build healthy habits," "sustainable habit change," "multi-behavior health" | Awareness |
| Coaching gap | "affordable health coaching," "health coach under $50," "AI health coaching" | Consideration |

### Conversion Funnel

```
Awareness (content, ads, word-of-mouth)
  → Landing page (use-case specific)
    → Email capture OR direct trial signup
      → 7-day free trial (full feature access)
        → Web app onboarding: Vision Framework + habit setup
          → Daily SMS engagement begins (reminders, check-ins)
            → Web app for reflections, resources, deeper tracking
              → Trial-to-paid conversion (target: 30%)
                → Retention via dual-channel: SMS for momentum, app for depth
```

### Digital Selling Strategy

- **Primary:** Direct-to-consumer via website → Stripe checkout
- **Trial-first:** 7-day free trial removes purchase friction; users experience both the web app and daily SMS coaching before paying
- **Tier upsell path:** Core users who plateau get targeted nudge to try Plus coaching; Plus users with complex needs see Premium value
- **Annual pricing (planned):** Offer ~17% discount for annual commitment to improve retention and cash flow predictability
- **No freemium tier:** Deliberate choice — free users wouldn't experience the SMS coaching relationship that drives retention. The 7-day trial is the free experience.

## 8. Management & Staff Structure

### Current Team: Solo Founder

**Eric Boggs — Founder, Designer, Developer, Coach**

Summit is currently a one-person operation by design. The founder's unique combination of skills eliminates the need for a larger team at this stage:

| Role | How It's Covered |
|------|-----------------|
| Product design & UX | Eric (Principal Software Designer, athenahealth) |
| Software development | Eric (full-stack: React, Supabase, Deno, Twilio) |
| Health coaching | Eric (Mayo Clinic Certified Health Coach, 2024) |
| Marketing & content | Eric + AI-assisted content creation |
| Business strategy | Eric + market research (see companion docs) |

### Current Operating Model

Summit is a **side project alongside full-time employment** at athenahealth. This is intentional:

- **Low burn rate:** No salary draw, no office, no payroll overhead
- **Patient growth:** Can prioritize product-market fit over growth speed
- **Built-in expertise:** Daily immersion in healthcare technology at athenahealth sharpens product instincts

### Coaching Capacity (Scaling Constraint)

As the sole coach, Eric's time is the primary constraint on Plus and Premium tiers. Plus sessions are 30 minutes; Premium includes 2x 30-min sessions plus ~30 min/month of concierge texting.

| Subscribers | Plus Load (30 min/user) | Premium Load (~90 min/user) | Total Hours/Month | Hours/Week |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| 145 users (30 Plus, 15 Premium) | 15 hrs | 22.5 hrs | **37.5 hrs** | **~9.4** |
| 250 users (52 Plus, 25 Premium) | 26 hrs | 37.5 hrs | **63.5 hrs** | **~15.9** ← stretching |
| 400 users (84 Plus, 40 Premium) | 42 hrs | 60 hrs | **102 hrs** | **~25.5** ← unsustainable solo |

**Scaling plan:**
- **0–150 users:** Eric handles all coaching (~9 hrs/week, manageable with day job)
- **150–300 users:** Approaching capacity; hire first contract coach ($35–40/hr); Eric focuses on Premium
- **300+ users:** Coaching team of 2–3; Eric transitions to coach training + product + strategy

### Future Hiring Priorities (By Revenue Milestone)

| Revenue | Hire | Why |
|---------|------|-----|
| $5K/month (~150 users) | Contract content writer | Scale blog/SEO without founder time |
| $8K/month (~250 users) | Part-time contract coach | Capacity relief for Plus/Premium tiers |
| $25K/month (~800 users) | Full-time coach + part-time marketer | Enable founder to focus on product and strategy |

## 9. Business Resume

### Eric Boggs — Founder

**Professional Experience**

- **Principal Software Designer, athenahealth** — Current
  - Leads UX and service design for healthcare technology products
  - Systems thinker specializing in complex healthcare workflows
  - Deep expertise in designing for behavior change and clinical outcomes

- **Mayo Clinic Certified Health Coach** — 2024
  - Evidence-based coaching methodology for sustainable behavior change
  - Training in motivational interviewing, goal setting, and habit formation
  - Clinical understanding of multi-behavior health coordination

**Unique Founder Advantage**

Eric is the rare combination of **designer, developer, and certified health coach** — able to:
- Identify user needs through coaching conversations
- Design solutions informed by UX research and service design principles
- Build and ship those solutions the same week
- Iterate based on real coaching relationships, not just analytics

This eliminates the communication overhead and misalignment that kills most early-stage products. The feedback loop between "what does this user need?" and "here's the solution" is measured in days, not sprints.

**Core Competencies**

| Domain | Depth |
|--------|-------|
| Healthcare UX / service design | Expert (daily practice at athenahealth) |
| Full-stack development (React, Node, Supabase, Deno) | Proficient (built Summit end-to-end) |
| Health coaching (Mayo Clinic methodology) | Certified (2024) |
| Behavior change science | Strong (applied in product + coaching) |
| SMS/conversational interface design | Applied (Summit's core differentiator) |
| AI/ML integration for health applications | Applied (GPT-4o-mini for coaching + curation) |

## 10. Strategic Framework

### What Summit Actually Is

Summit is not a habit tracker. It is not an SMS coaching app. It is:

> **A vision-driven habit adherence system that combines human coaching judgment with AI-personalized reinforcement.**

The strategic edge is not content, not features, not any single channel — it's **reinforcement architecture:** the system of vision-setting, daily SMS accountability, AI-curated nudges, structured reflection, and human coaching that together create durable behavior change.

Key differentiators through this lens:

| Differentiator | Why It Matters |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Vision creation anchors all behavior change** | Users build identity before tactics — this creates internal motivation, not just external compliance |
| **AI generates personalized reinforcement** | Habit suggestions, content curation, and response parsing scale without human bottleneck |
| **SMS provides high-signal engagement in a low-noise channel** | Text cuts through where push notifications don't — pilot validated this unanimously |
| **Web app provides depth for planning and reflection** | Dashboard, tracking, reflections, and resources serve the "thinking" side of change |
| **Human coaching enhances identity shifts** | AI can track habits; humans help people see themselves differently |

This is not a feature comparison. It's a **reinforcement architecture** that incumbents would need to fundamentally restructure to replicate.

### The Primary KPI: Retention

Acquisition is vanity. Retention is viability.

> **If users do not stay 6+ months, the model does not compound.**

The single most important metric is **average subscription length**. Everything else — acquisition, revenue, features — is downstream of whether people stay.

**Supporting metrics (in priority order):**

| Metric | Why It Matters | Target |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Month 1 retention** | First 30 days predict everything | > 85% |
| **3-month retention** | Proves habit adherence, not novelty | > 60% |
| **6-month retention** | Validates the model compounds | > 45% |
| **SMS response rate** | Engagement proxy — are people responding to texts? | > 50% |
| **Coaching session attendance** | Plus/Premium users using what they pay for | > 75% |
| **Weekly reflection completion** | Users doing the "thinking" work | > 40% |
| **Habit completion consistency** | The actual outcome | Trending up over 90 days |

**Go/No-Go Decision Framework:**

This prevents emotional decision-making. Write it down now, hold yourself to it later.

| Threshold | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| **60%+ retain after 3 months** | Double down. Invest in growth, content, product. This is working. |
| **40–60% retain after 3 months** | Iterate. The core is there but something is leaking. Investigate churn interviews, onboarding friction, SMS cadence. |
| **< 40% retain after 3 months** | Pause growth spending. Fundamental product-market fit question. Go back to 1:1 conversations with churned users before scaling. |

### AI Integration Strategy

AI is a tool, not the product. The founder's coaching judgment defines what's safe and effective to automate.

**AI handles now:**
- Habit suggestion generation
- SMS response parsing and logging
- Weekly content digest curation
- Vision analysis and archetype classification

**Human handles now (and should, until patterns are proven):**
- Emotional nuance in coaching sessions
- Identity transitions and motivation shifts
- High-stakes personal decisions
- Determining when a user is struggling vs. disengaged

**Automation philosophy:** Observe patterns in human coaching first. Identify repeatable judgment. Productize only what's been validated. Premature automation degrades the experience before you understand why it worked.

**Phased automation roadmap:**

| Phase | What Gets Automated | When |
|-------|-------------------|------|
| **Now** | Habit reminders, tracking, content curation, response parsing | Launched |
| **After 100 users** | Pattern-based re-engagement ("You've been quiet — want to adjust your plan?") | After churn patterns are observed |
| **After 250 users** | AI-generated coaching prep (session summaries, suggested topics for coach) | After enough coaching sessions to identify patterns |
| **After 500 users** | AI-mediated coaching for common scenarios (backup plans, habit pivots) | Only after human coaching proves what works |

### Founder Sustainability & Burnout Prevention

The biggest risk to Summit is not money or market — it's the founder trying to do everything indefinitely.

**Strategy:**
1. **Over-serve initially** to identify where human involvement materially changes outcomes
2. **Track every coaching interaction** — what questions come up, what moves the needle, what's rote
3. **Gradually productize repeatable judgment** — turn coaching patterns into AI prompts, onboarding improvements, and content
4. **Set hard boundaries:**
   - Coaching hours capped at 15 hrs/week maximum while employed full-time
   - No concierge texting outside business hours (Premium users get async, not 24/7)
   - Weekly "Summit time" blocks — don't let it bleed into every evening

**Goal:** Reduce operational load over time without degrading outcomes. The product should get better as the founder does less hands-on coaching — because the system has absorbed the founder's judgment.

### Legal & Positioning Safeguards

Summit is clearly positioned as:
- **Educational and wellness-oriented** — not clinical, not medical, not therapeutic
- **Coaching, not treatment** — behavior change support, not diagnosis or prescription

**Implementation (pre-launch checklist):**

| Safeguard | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Website footer disclaimer ("not a substitute for medical advice") | Planned |
| Onboarding acknowledgment checkbox ("I understand this is wellness coaching, not medical care") | Planned |
| Crisis redirect protocol (if user indicates self-harm or emergency → provide resources, do not attempt to coach through it) | Planned |
| Terms of Service with liability limitations | Planned |
| Privacy policy (HIPAA not required for non-clinical wellness, but data handling should be responsible) | Planned |

Minimal but responsible compliance posture. Revisit if Summit ever moves toward clinical outcomes, employer wellness contracts, or insurance reimbursement.

### Strategic Identity

Current orientation:

> **Purpose-driven, outcome-first lifestyle business serving a defined community.**

This is not a venture-scale play until it proves it should be. The order of operations:

1. **Prove retention** — do people stay 6+ months?
2. **Prove the model** — can AI handle enough that the founder isn't the bottleneck?
3. **Prove unit economics at scale** — do margins hold when coaching is staffed?
4. **Then** consider whether to raise capital, pursue B2B, or stay lifestyle

Scale is conditional on demonstrated durable behavior change, strong retention, and operational leverage. Premature scaling is the most common way to kill a good product.

## 11. Financial Projections

### Assumptions & Methodology

All projections are based on:
- **Launch date:** March 2026
- **Bootstrapped / self-funded** — no outside investment, no salary draw for founder
- **Side project model** — founder maintains full-time employment; Summit is incremental
- **Tier distribution:** 69% Core / 21% Plus / 10% Premium (based on pilot feedback and coaching capacity modeling)
- **Monthly churn:** 8% Core, 5% Plus, 3% Premium (health app industry averages)
- **Trial-to-paid conversion:** 30% (conservative; industry recently improved from 2% to 7% for cold traffic; Summit's pilot converts should be higher)
- **Growth:** 25–35% month-over-month in early months, tapering to 15–20% as base grows

---

### Expense Categories

#### Variable Costs (Per User, Per Month)

| Expense | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Twilio SMS** | ~$0.50/user | ~15–20 messages/month per user (reminders + responses) at $0.0079/segment |
| **OpenAI API** | ~$0.15/user | GPT-4o-mini for weekly digests, vision analysis, SMS parsing |
| **Stripe processing** | ~3% of revenue | 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (monthly billing) |
| **Total variable** | **~$0.65/user + 3% of revenue** | |

#### Fixed Costs (Monthly, Regardless of User Count)

| Expense | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Supabase Pro** | $25 | Database, auth, edge functions |
| **Domain + DNS** | $2 | ~$20/year |
| **Hosting (Vercel/Netlify)** | $0–20 | Free tier sufficient initially |
| **Resend (email)** | $0–20 | Free tier for low volume; $20/mo at scale |
| **Cal.com** | $0–12 | Free tier or Teams plan |
| **PostHog** | $0 | Free tier for analytics |
| **Twilio phone number** | $2 | $1–2/month per number |
| **Miscellaneous** | $10 | Buffer for tooling, domains, etc. |
| **Total fixed** | **~$60–90/month** | Using $75/month as baseline |

---

### Revenue Estimates

#### Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

| Tier | % of Users | Monthly Price | Weighted Revenue |
|------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Core | 69% | $12 | $8.28 |
| Plus | 21% | $49 | $10.29 |
| Premium | 10% | $119 | $11.90 |
| **Blended ARPU** | | | **$30.47/user/month** |

> **Pricing context:** Market rates for health coaching are $50–$200/month for 2 sessions. Plus at $49 (one 30-min session + full AI platform) is priced below the $50–$75 floor for new coaches. Premium at $119 (two sessions + concierge texting + AI platform) competes favorably with $100–$200 coaching subscriptions. Both tiers deliver clear value above their price point.

#### Revenue at Key Milestones

| Users | Monthly Revenue | Annual Run Rate |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 10 | $305 | $3,656 |
| 50 | $1,524 | $18,282 |
| 100 | $3,047 | $36,564 |
| 145 | $4,418 | $53,018 |
| 250 | $7,618 | $91,410 |
| 500 | $15,235 | $182,820 |
| 1,000 | $30,470 | $365,640 |

### Gross Profit Analysis

#### Per-User Unit Economics (SaaS Costs Only)

| | Core ($12) | Plus ($49) | Premium ($119) |
|---|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Price | $12.00 | $49.00 | $119.00 |
| Twilio SMS | -$0.50 | -$0.50 | -$1.00 (more messages) |
| OpenAI API | -$0.15 | -$0.15 | -$0.25 |
| Stripe (3%) | -$0.36 | -$1.47 | -$3.57 |
| **SaaS gross profit/user** | **$10.99** | **$46.88** | **$114.18** |
| **SaaS gross margin** | **91.6%** | **95.7%** | **95.9%** |

#### Per-User Unit Economics (Including Coaching Labor)

Coaching time valued at $50/hr (opportunity cost / contract coach rate):

| | Core ($12) | Plus ($49) | Premium ($119) |
|---|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| SaaS gross profit | $10.99 | $46.88 | $114.18 |
| Coaching labor (@ $50/hr) | $0 | -$25.00 (30 min) | -$75.00 (1 hr + 30 min texts) |
| **Fully loaded profit/user** | **$10.99** | **~$22** | **~$39** |
| **Fully loaded margin** | **91.6%** | **~45%** | **~33%** |

#### Blended Gross Profit

| Metric | SaaS Only | With Coaching Labor |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Blended ARPU | $30.47 | $30.47 |
| Blended variable cost/user | $1.63 | — |
| **Blended gross profit/user** | **$28.84** | **~$16** |
| **Blended gross margin** | **94.6%** | **~53%** |

> **Note on coaching labor:** While Eric is the sole coach, coaching time is a founder time investment, not a cash expense — the SaaS-only margin is the real cash margin. The "fully loaded" view models what unit economics look like when coaching is staffed. Even at 33% margin, Premium at $119/month is well below market rates for comparable coaching ($100–$200/month), leaving room for price increases as demand justifies it.

---

### Fixed Cost Estimates

| Scenario | Monthly Fixed Costs |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Pre-launch / soft launch** | $75 |
| **At 100 users** | $90 (email + hosting tiers increase slightly) |
| **At 500 users** | $120 (higher-tier Supabase, email, etc.) |
| **At 1,000 users** | $175 (scaling infrastructure) |

---

### Break-Even Points

#### Break-Even Formula

```
Break-even users = Fixed costs / Gross profit per user
```

#### Monthly Operating Break-Even

| Scenario | Fixed Costs | Gross Profit/User | Break-Even Users |
|----------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Minimum (current)** | $75/month | $28.84 | **3 users** |
| **At 100 users** | $90/month | $28.84 | **4 users** |
| **With marketing spend ($200/mo)** | $275/month | $28.84 | **10 users** |
| **With marketing ($500/mo)** | $575/month | $28.84 | **20 users** |

> The extremely low break-even point is a direct benefit of the bootstrapped, side-project model with no salary expense and minimal fixed costs. Summit is profitable from the first handful of paying subscribers.

#### Break-Even with Founder Salary Draw (Future Scenario)

If Eric transitions to full-time and draws a salary:

| Salary Draw | Total Fixed | Break-Even Users |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| $3,000/month | $3,075 | **107 users** |
| $5,000/month | $5,075 | **176 users** |
| $8,000/month | $8,075 | **280 users** |

### Scenario Modeling (Good / Better / Best)

The base-case P&L below uses the "Better" scenario. Here's how all three compare.

**Key assumptions that vary by scenario:**

| Assumption | Good (Validation) | Better (Sustainable) | Best (Inflection) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Month 12 active users | 80 | 240 | 400 |
| Tier mix (Core/Plus/Premium) | 80/15/5 | 69/21/10 | 55/28/17 |
| Blended ARPU | $18.55 | $30.47 | $41.75 |
| Monthly churn (blended) | 10% | 7% | 5% |
| Trial-to-paid conversion | 20% | 30% | 40% |
| Marketing spend (Month 12) | $0 | $400 | $800 |
| Coaching hours/month (M12) | ~11 hrs | ~61 hrs | ~130 hrs |

#### Good Case — "Validation Phase" (80 users by Month 12)

Slow organic growth. Most users are Core. Coaching demand is light. The business validates that people will pay and stay, but hasn't found a growth engine yet.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Month 12 revenue | ~$1,484/month |
| Year 1 total revenue | ~$10,000 |
| Year 1 net profit | ~$8,700 (no marketing spend, minimal costs) |
| Coaching hours at M12 | ~11 hrs/month (~2.75 hrs/week) |
| Founder time required | Low — sustainable alongside full-time job |

**What this scenario means:** Product works but growth is a question mark. Use this time to deeply understand the 80 users who stayed — what do they have in common? What made them convert? Double down on that profile.

#### Better Case — "Sustainable Lifestyle Business" (240 users by Month 12)

Steady organic + content-driven growth. Healthy tier mix. Coaching demand is meaningful but manageable. The founder could begin considering a transition to full-time.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Month 12 revenue | ~$7,313/month ($88K ARR) |
| Year 1 total revenue | ~$39,900 |
| Year 1 net profit | ~$34,500 |
| Coaching hours at M12 | ~61 hrs/month (~15 hrs/week) ← stretching alongside day job |
| Founder time required | High — coaching + product + marketing requires careful time management |

**What this scenario means:** This is a real business. Revenue supports a modest salary draw. Retention data should be strong enough to decide whether to go full-time. At this pace, 1,000 users arrives around Month 20 — but coaching capacity forces a hire well before that.

#### Best Case — "Leverage Inflection" (400 users by Month 12)

Content marketing hits, a podcast appearance drives signups, or word-of-mouth takes off. Tier mix skews toward coaching (higher ARPU). Churn is low. The business is growing faster than one person can sustainably serve.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Month 12 revenue | ~$16,700/month ($200K ARR) |
| Year 1 total revenue | ~$86,000 |
| Year 1 net profit | ~$73,000 |
| Coaching hours at M12 | ~130 hrs/month ← **unsustainable solo** |
| Founder time required | Full-time + first hire needed immediately |

**What this scenario means:** Growth is outpacing capacity. Must hire a contract coach or cap coaching tiers. The good problem — but a real operational constraint. This scenario forces the full-time transition decision and the first hire ($35–40/hr contract coach) well before Month 12.

#### Scenario Comparison

| | Good | Better | Best |
|---|------|--------|------|
| **Year 1 revenue** | ~$10,000 | ~$39,900 | ~$86,000 |
| **Year 1 net profit** | ~$8,700 | ~$34,500 | ~$73,000 |
| **Month to 100 users** | Not reached | Month 7 | Month 5 |
| **Cash-flow positive?** | Month 1 | Month 1 | Month 1 |
| **Coaching sustainable solo?** | Yes | Stretched by M10 | No — hire by M6 |
| **Go full-time signal?** | Not yet | Maybe by M12 | Yes by M8 |

> **In all three scenarios, Summit is cash-flow positive from Month 1.** The risk is never financial survival — it's whether retention proves durable enough to justify the founder's time investment, and whether coaching capacity can scale with demand.

### Profit & Loss Forecast (12-Month, Base Case)

_Better scenario. Launch: March 2026. Growth assumes organic + content marketing. No paid ads until Month 6._

| Month | Total Users | New Users | Churned | Revenue | Variable Costs | Fixed Costs | Marketing | **Net Profit** |
|-------|------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| **M1** (Mar) | 12 | 12 | 0 | $366 | $20 | $75 | $0 | **$271** |

| **M9** (Nov) | 158 | 33 | 8 | $4,814 | $258 | $85 | $300 | **$4,172** |
| **M10** (Dec) | 182 | 33 | 9 | $5,546 | $297 | $85 | $300 | **$4,864** |
| **M11** (Jan) | 210 | 38 | 10 | $6,399 | $342 | $90 | $400 | **$5,567** |
| **M12** (Feb) | 240 | 42 | 12 | $7,313 | $391 | $90 | $400 | **$6,432** |
| | | | | | | | | |
| **Year 1 Total** | | **307 new** | **67 churned** | **$39,856** | **$2,134** | **$970** | **$2,300** | **$34,452** |

**Year 1 highlights:**
- 240 active paying subscribers by month 12
- $39,856 total revenue ($88K ARR at M12 run rate)
- $34,452 net profit (86.4% net margin — no salary draw)
- 100-user milestone hit in Month 7
- Coaching hours at Month 12: ~61 hrs/month (~15 hrs/week — stretching alongside day job, first hire signal)

### Start-Up Cost Estimate

_Costs already incurred or needed before/at launch._

| Category | Item | Cost | Status |
|----------|------|------|--------|
| **Development** | Founder's time (design + code) | $0 (sweat equity) | Completed |
| **Infrastructure** | Supabase Pro (pre-launch months) | $75 | Incurred |
| **Infrastructure** | Domain registration | $15 | Incurred |
| **Infrastructure** | Twilio setup + test SMS | $20 | Incurred |
| **Legal** | Privacy policy / Terms of Service | $0–200 | Template or legal review |
| **Brand** | Logo, visual identity | $0–300 | DIY or freelance |
| **Marketing** | Landing page copywriting | $0 (founder) | In progress |
| **Marketing** | Product Hunt / launch prep | $0 | Planned |
| **Certification** | Mayo Clinic Health Coach program | ~$3,000 | Completed (2024) |
| **Education** | Behavior change / coaching books, courses | ~$200 | Ongoing |
| | | | |
| **Total start-up costs** | | **~$3,500–3,800** | Largely already incurred |

> Start-up costs are minimal because the founder is the designer, developer, and coach. The largest investment was the Mayo Clinic certification, which is both a personal credential and a business asset.

### Cash Flow Projections (12-Month)

_Assumes all revenue collected via Stripe with standard processing delays (2-day payout). Monthly cash basis._

| Month | Cash In (Revenue) | Cash Out (Costs) | **Monthly Cash Flow** | **Cumulative Cash** |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| **Pre-launch** | $0 | $110 (infra) | -$110 | -$110 |
| **M1** (Mar) | $366 | $95 | +$271 | +$161 |
| **M2** (Apr) | $670 | $111 | +$559 | +$720 |
| **M3** (May) | $1,066 | $132 | +$934 | +$1,654 |
| **M4** (Jun) | $1,524 | $257 | +$1,267 | +$2,921 |
| **M5** (Jul) | $2,072 | $286 | +$1,786 | +$4,707 |
| **M6** (Aug) | $2,681 | $424 | +$2,258 | +$6,964 |
| **M7** (Sep) | $3,352 | $459 | +$2,893 | +$9,857 |
| **M8** (Oct) | $4,053 | $602 | +$3,451 | +$13,308 |
| **M9** (Nov) | $4,814 | $643 | +$4,172 | +$17,480 |
| **M10** (Dec) | $5,546 | $682 | +$4,864 | +$22,344 |
| **M11** (Jan '27) | $6,399 | $832 | +$5,567 | +$27,911 |
| **M12** (Feb '27) | $7,313 | $881 | +$6,432 | +$34,343 |

**Key takeaway:** Summit is cash-flow positive from Month 1. The bootstrapped model with near-zero fixed costs means there is no "cash valley" to survive — every paying subscriber contributes to cumulative cash from day one.

### Financial Summary & Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Blended ARPU** | $30.47/month |
| **Blended SaaS gross margin** | 94.6% |
| **Blended fully loaded margin** | ~53% (with coaching labor at $50/hr) |
| **Operating break-even** | 3 paying users |
| **Break-even with $5K salary draw** | 176 users |
| **Year 1 projected revenue (base case)** | $39,856 |
| **Year 1 projected net profit** | $34,452 |
| **Year 1 projected subscribers** | 240 |
| **Month to 100 users** | ~Month 7 |
| **Month to 1,000 users** | ~Month 20 (Year 2) |
| **Customer LTV (Core, 8% churn)** | $150 (12.5 months avg) |
| **Customer LTV (Plus, 5% churn)** | $980 (20 months avg) |
| **Customer LTV (Premium, 3% churn)** | $3,967 (33 months avg) |
| **Blended LTV** | ~$706 |
| **Target CAC** | < $30 (organic) / < $60 (paid) |
| **LTV:CAC ratio** | 12:1 (organic) / 5.9:1 (paid) |
| **Coaching capacity limit (solo)** | ~150 users before first hire needed |
| **Total start-up investment** | ~$3,500–3,800 |

### Assumption Stress Tests

The projections above use the Better (base) case. Here's what breaks the model:

| Assumption | Base Value | What If It's Wrong? | Impact |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **Blended churn at 7%** | 7%/month | If 12% (common in health apps) | Year 1 subscribers: ~160 instead of 240. Still profitable, but growth stalls. |
| **Tier mix 69/21/10** | ARPU $30.47 | If 85/10/5 (most stay Core) | ARPU drops to $21.05. Year 1 revenue: ~$27K. Still profitable but coaching revenue underwhelms. |
| **Trial conversion at 30%** | 30% | If 15% (cold traffic, no referrals) | Need 2x the trial signups to hit same user count. Marketing spend matters more. |
| **Core price at $12** | $12/month | If dropped to $8 (per pilot feedback floor) | Year 1 revenue drops ~25% if Core-heavy. Consider only if it meaningfully improves conversion. |
| **Coaching capacity** | Solo founder | If demand exceeds 15 hrs/week | Must hire or cap coaching tiers. Contract coach at $35–40/hr adds ~$2–4K/month in costs depending on caseload. Hire signal comes earlier (~150 users) with new session lengths. |

### Key Financial Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Retention below 3 months** | Model doesn't compound; LTV collapses | See Section 10 go/no-go thresholds. Invest in onboarding quality and first-week SMS engagement before growth. |
| **Coaching capacity bottleneck** | Can't grow Plus/Premium tiers | Hire contract coach at ~250 users; shift tier mix toward Core if needed |
| **Over-automation before pattern validation** | Degrades experience, increases churn | Follow phased AI roadmap in Section 10; human-first until patterns are proven |
| **Weak differentiation messaging** | Prospects don't understand why Summit is different | Refine positioning around reinforcement architecture, not features |
| **Twilio cost increases or carrier issues** | Higher variable costs; SMS delivery failures (see Jesse's pilot experience) | Monitor delivery rates; negotiate volume pricing; explore RCS/WhatsApp as fallback |
| **Low trial conversion** | Slower growth | A/B test onboarding; extend trial to 14 days if needed |
| **Founder burnout** | Product stalls | Hard caps on coaching hours (Section 10); protect boundaries; hire before breaking |
