## Problem Section

### Sound familiar?

- You've downloaded more health apps than you can count
- You start strong, then life happens, then guilt happens
- Tracking feels like a chore—and you're not even sure it helps
- You know what you *should* do. You just can't make it stick.

**The problem isn't you. It's the approach.**

Most apps throw habits at you and hope something sticks. They reward streaks, not learning. They want you glued to a dashboard, not living your life.

**There's a better way.**

---

## Solution Section

### A different kind of health support

Summit starts with what matters to *you*—then builds everything around it.

**Your vision first.** Before any habits, you'll clarify what health actually means for you. Not a generic goal. Your personal North Star.

**Habits that cascade from your vision.** AI suggests habits based on what you said matters. Not random tips—your next step.

**Reflection, not just tracking.** Each week, you'll pause to see what's working. Your vision stays constant; your approach evolves.

**Support via text.** SMS reminders, check-ins, and coaching—all in your messages. No app to open. No dashboard to check.

3. Get Gentle Reminders
   SMS nudges when you need them. Silence when you don't.

4. Reflect Weekly
   3 questions. 5 minutes. Learn what actually works for you.

        ↓

5. Adjust & Repeat
   Keep what works. Drop what doesn't. Your approach evolves with you.
```

**All via text. AI handles the daily. A real coach steps in when it matters.**

## The 4 Pillars Section

### What makes Summit different

**🎯 Vision First**
Before habits, you'll clarify what you actually want and why it matters. Everything else—your habits, your content, your coaching—flows from that.

**📱 SMS by Design**
Your health coach lives in your messages. No app to download. No dashboard to check. No notification fatigue from another wellness app.

**🤖 + 🧑 AI + Human Hybrid**
AI handles the daily touchpoints—reminders, check-ins, content curation. A real coach steps in for the meaningful moments.

**🪞 Reflection Over Tracking**
We reward you for pausing to think, not for logging streaks. Weekly reflection is where the real learning happens.

## The Reflection Reward

### We reward thinking, not tracking

Most apps reward you for logging every day. We think that's backwards.

**The habit that matters most is reflection**—stopping to ask what worked, what didn't, and what to try next. That's how real change happens.

Complete your weekly reflection and you're entered to win a personalized gift. Because pausing to think deserves recognition.
