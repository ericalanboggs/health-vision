## FAQ Section

### Common questions

**What happens after the free trial?**
After 7 days, you'll be asked to choose a plan. If you don't, your account stays active but you won't receive reminders or new content. You can upgrade anytime.

**Can I switch between plans?**
Yes, anytime. Upgrade to Premium for coaching support, or switch to Core if you prefer self-guided. Changes take effect on your next billing cycle.

**Is there a contract or commitment?**
No. Both plans are month-to-month (or annual if you choose). Cancel anytime with no penalty.

**What's included in the coaching calls?**
Premium members get bi-weekly 15-minute calls with a real health coach. These are focused sessions—reviewing your reflections, troubleshooting obstacles, and planning your next experiment.

**How do SMS reminders work?**
You'll receive text messages at times you choose—gentle nudges for your habits. No app to open. Reply to check in or ask questions (Premium members get priority responses).

**Do I need to download an app?**
Nope. Summit works via text message and a simple web dashboard. Most of your interaction happens in your messages, not an app.

**What if I miss a week?**
No guilt, no lost streaks. Summit is designed for real life. Miss a week? Your next reflection just picks up where you left off. No judgment.

**Can I use Summit for multiple health goals?**
Yes! Your vision can include multiple areas—energy, sleep, stress, movement, nutrition. Summit helps you coordinate across behaviors, not just track one thing.

**What makes Summit different from other habit apps?**
Three things: (1) Vision-first—you define what matters before picking habits. (2) SMS-native—no app obsession required. (3) Reflection over tracking—we reward thinking, not streaks.

**Is my data private?**
Yes. We don't sell your data. Your reflections and health information are yours. See our Privacy Policy for details.
