# Sleep Landing Page (`/sleep`)

## Hero Section

**Headline:**
# Fall asleep faster. Wake up actually rested.

**Subhead:**
You know sleep matters. You've read the articles, tried the apps, bought the supplements. But you're still tired. Summit helps you find the sleep habits that work for *your* life—not someone else's perfect routine.

## Problem Section

### The sleep advice trap

- "Put your phone away an hour before bed" — Sure, but then what?
- "Keep your room cool and dark" — Done. Still can't sleep.
- "Stick to a consistent schedule" — Great, except life happens.
- Sleep trackers tell you *that* you slept badly, not *how* to fix it.

**The real problem:** Generic sleep advice ignores everything else in your life. Your stress. Your schedule. Your 3pm coffee. Your racing thoughts at midnight.

**Sleep isn't just about bedtime. It's about the 16 hours before it.**

---

## Solution Section

### A different approach to sleep

Summit doesn't give you a list of sleep hygiene tips and call it a day.

Instead, we help you:

1. **Define what "better sleep" actually means for you** — Falling asleep faster? Staying asleep? Waking up refreshed? Get specific.

2. **Experiment with habits that affect sleep** — Not just bedtime routines, but stress, caffeine timing, movement, wind-down rituals.

3. **Reflect weekly on what's changing** — Track patterns you'd never notice otherwise. "Oh, I sleep terribly after late workouts."

4. **Adjust based on real data** — Your data. Your life. Not a generic protocol.

5. **Get support when you're stuck** — AI nudges you daily. A real coach helps when nothing's working.

**All via text. No sleep tracker judgment. No app to check at 2am.**

## How It Works Section

### The Summit approach

```
Week 1: Define your sleep vision
        ↓
        AI suggests habits that might help
        (evening wind-down, caffeine cutoff, morning light, stress practices)
        ↓
        You pick 1-2 to try this week
        ↓
Week 2: Reflect on what changed
        ↓
        See patterns: What helped? What didn't?
        ↓
        Adjust, keep, or try something new
        ↓
Repeat: Build your personal sleep playbook over time
```

**This isn't a 7-day sleep challenge. It's a system for figuring out what YOUR body needs.**

## The Multi-Behavioral Truth

### Sleep isn't just about bedtime

Most sleep advice focuses on the hour before bed. But sleep quality is shaped by your entire day:

- **Morning light exposure** → Sets your circadian rhythm
- **Caffeine timing** → That 2pm coffee might be why you're up at midnight
- **Stress and anxiety** → Racing thoughts don't stop because you closed your eyes
- **Movement** → Helps sleep, unless it's too late in the day
- **Evening screens** → Yes, but also *what* you're watching (doomscrolling vs. calm content)

Summit helps you experiment across all of these—and find your personal formula.

**Your sleep is unique. Your solution should be too.**
