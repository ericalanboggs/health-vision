## Key Differentiators

1. **SMS-first** — Only multi-behavior health coaching that works via text
2. **Vision-first** — Everything cascades from your personal health vision
3. **AI + Human hybrid** — AI daily, human when it matters
4. **Reflection rewards** — We reward thinking, not tracking

## Recommended Taglines

- "Health coaching via text. Finally."
- "Your vision. Your habits. Your pace."
- "AI handles the daily. Humans handle the meaningful."
