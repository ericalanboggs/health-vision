## Core Value Proposition

**One-liner:**
Summit is health coaching via text—AI-powered nudges, human support when it matters, and weekly reflection that helps you build habits around what actually matters to you.

**Expanded (for landing page):**
Most health apps want you glued to a dashboard. Summit starts with your vision, then supports it via text—with AI that nudges, a coach who cares, and weekly content tailored to what you're actually working on.

## The 4 Pillars

### 1. Vision First
Before habits, you'll clarify what you actually want and why it matters. Everything else—your habits, your content, your coaching—flows from that.

**Key message:** "Start with what matters to you, not a generic goal."

### 2. AI + Human Hybrid
AI handles the daily touchpoints—reminders, check-ins, content curation. A real coach steps in for the meaningful moments: when you're stuck, struggling, or celebrating.

**Key message:** "Smart automation for the routine. Human support when it counts."

### 3. SMS by Design
Your health coach lives in your messages. No app to download. No dashboard to check. No notification fatigue from another wellness app.

**Key message:** "Works where you already are—your texts."

### 4. Reflection Over Tracking
We reward you for pausing to think, not for logging streaks. Weekly reflection is where the real learning happens: What worked? What didn't? What's next?

**Key message:** "Learn what works for YOU, not what works in theory."
