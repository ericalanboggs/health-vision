## Hero Section

**Headline:**
# Manage stress without becoming a meditation guru.

**Subhead:**
You don't need another app telling you to breathe. You need real strategies that fit your actual life—and support figuring out what works for *you*. Summit helps you build stress habits that stick, via text.

## Problem Section

### The meditation app graveyard

- You downloaded Calm. And Headspace. And that other one.
- You meditated for a week, felt good, then... stopped.
- "Just take deep breaths" doesn't help when you're in back-to-back meetings.
- You know stress is killing you slowly. But the solutions feel like another thing on your to-do list.

**The real problem:** Most stress advice is either too passive (meditate!) or too vague (set boundaries!). You need concrete habits that fit into a busy life—and a way to figure out which ones actually help *you*.

**Stress management isn't one-size-fits-all. What calms your nervous system might not work for someone else.**

## Solution Section

### A different approach to stress

Summit doesn't just tell you to meditate and hope for the best.

Instead, we help you:

1. **Define what "less stress" actually looks like** — Not just "feel calmer" but specific: better sleep, fewer snappy moments, more patience, clearer thinking.

2. **Experiment with stress habits that fit your life** — Breathing techniques, micro-breaks, boundaries, movement, journaling, wind-down rituals. You pick what's realistic.

3. **Reflect weekly on what's shifting** — Notice patterns. "I'm less reactive when I take that 5-minute walk after lunch."

4. **Adjust based on your life** — Stressors change. Your habits can too. No rigid protocols.

5. **Get human support when you're overwhelmed** — AI handles daily nudges. A real coach helps when you're drowning.

**All via text. No app to open when you're already overstimulated.**

        AI suggests habits that might help
        (breathing, boundaries, movement, micro-breaks, evening wind-down)
        ↓
        You pick 1-2 to try this week
        ↓
Week 2: Reflect on what shifted
        ↓
        Notice: What helped? What felt forced?
        ↓
        Keep what works, drop what doesn't
        ↓
Repeat: Build your personal stress toolkit over time
```

## The Multi-Behavioral Truth

### Stress affects everything. Everything affects stress.

You can't fix stress in isolation:

- **Poor sleep** → Lower stress tolerance → More reactive
- **No movement** → Nervous energy with nowhere to go
- **Skipped meals** → Blood sugar crashes → Irritability
- **No boundaries** → Constant demands → Burnout
- **No wind-down** → Work brain at bedtime → Poor sleep → Repeat

Summit helps you see these connections and experiment across behaviors. Stress might be the symptom, but the solution could be sleep, movement, or boundaries.

**Start with one habit. See what shifts. Build from there.**

## What Stress Habits Actually Look Like

These aren't vague tips. These are real habits Summit might suggest:

- **2-minute breathing reset** before your first meeting
- **5-minute walk** after lunch (no phone)
- **"Shutdown ritual"** to end your workday with intention
- **10-minute evening wind-down** — stretching, journaling, or just sitting
- **Boundary script** for saying no to one thing this week
- **Morning "stress inoculation"** — cold water, movement, or silence before inputs

**You don't do all of these. You experiment with 1-2 at a time and see what helps.**
