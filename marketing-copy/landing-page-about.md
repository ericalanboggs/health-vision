## The Origin Story

### I've watched hundreds of people try to change their health.

I'm Eric, a health coach. For years, I've worked with people who *know* what they should do but can't make it stick.

They've tried the apps. Downloaded MyFitnessPal, Noom, Headspace, Fitbit—sometimes all of them. They start strong. Track everything. Feel motivated.

Then life happens.

A stressful week. A missed workout. A streak broken. And suddenly they feel like failures—not because they failed, but because the app made them feel that way.

**I kept seeing the same pattern:**
- Apps that reward obsessive tracking, not actual learning
- Generic advice that ignores their real life
- All-or-nothing approaches that collapse at the first obstacle
- No human support when things get hard

So I built something different.

## The Philosophy

### What I believe about health change

**1. Vision before habits.**
Most apps ask "what habit do you want to build?" That's the wrong question. The right question is: "What does health mean to *you*?" When you're clear on your vision, the right habits become obvious.

**2. Reflection beats tracking.**
Logging every meal and step doesn't teach you anything. Pausing weekly to ask "what worked?" does. The habit that matters most is thinking—not tracking.

**3. Small experiments, not big commitments.**
"I'm going to work out 5 days a week" is a setup for failure. "I'm going to try a 10-minute walk after lunch and see how it feels" is how real change happens.

**4. Support should fit your life.**
Most people don't need a full-time health coach. They need a nudge at the right moment. AI can handle the daily reminders. Humans should step in when it actually matters.

**5. SMS is underrated.**
We're all drowning in apps. But texts? We read those. A simple text reminder at the right time is worth more than a fancy dashboard you never open.

## Why Summit Is Different

### This isn't another tracking app.

| What Most Apps Do | What Summit Does |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Start with habits | Start with your vision |
| Reward streaks | Reward reflection |
| Require daily logging | Nudge when helpful, stay quiet when not |
| Live in an app | Live in your text messages |
| Automate everything | AI daily, human when it matters |
| Generic for everyone | Personalized to your vision |

## The Approach

### How Summit actually works

**Your vision is the foundation.**
Before any habits, you'll clarify what health means to you—not a generic goal, but your personal North Star. This becomes the anchor for everything.

**Everything cascades from your vision.**
The habits AI suggests? Based on your vision. The content we curate? Matched to what you're working on. The coaching support? Focused on your goals.

**Weekly reflection is the engine.**
Each week, you'll answer three simple questions: What worked? What didn't? What will you try next? This is where the real learning happens.

**SMS keeps it simple.**
Reminders, check-ins, and support—all via text. No app to open. No dashboard to maintain. Just messages that meet you where you are.

**Human support when it counts.**
AI handles the routine. A real coach steps in for the breakthroughs and the breakdowns—the moments when you actually need a person.

## About Eric

### The coach behind Summit

[Photo placeholder]

**Eric Boggs**
*Founder & Coach*

I've spent years as a health coach, working with people on behavior change. I've seen what works and what doesn't. Summit is everything I wish existed when I started coaching.

Before Summit, I was [brief background—relevant experience, what led to this].

I still coach Summit Premium members personally. When you get on a call with Summit, there's a good chance it's me.

**My approach:**
- No judgment—ever
- Progress over perfection
- Curious about what works for *you*, not what works in theory
- Honest about what I don't know

## The Vision for Summit

### Where we're headed

Summit started as a simple idea: what if health coaching worked via text?

Now it's becoming something bigger—a system that helps people figure out what actually works for *their* health, *their* stress, *their* energy, *their* life.

**Our vision:**
- Health support that fits real life, not the other way around
- AI that handles the routine so humans can focus on what matters
- Reflection as the core habit—because learning beats logging
- Affordable coaching that isn't just for the wealthy

We're just getting started.

## Our Values

### What we believe

**🪞 Reflection over tracking**
Pausing to think is more valuable than logging every detail. We reward learning, not streaks.

**🌱 Small experiments**
Lasting change comes from tiny tests, not massive overhauls. Try something small. See what happens.

**🤝 Human when it matters**
AI is great for reminders. Humans are great for support. We use both where they work best.

**🙅 No guilt**
Missed a day? A week? A month? No judgment. Just pick up where you left off.

**🔒 Your data is yours**
We don't sell your information. Your reflections, your health data, your journey—it all belongs to you.
