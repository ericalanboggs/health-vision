## Hero Section

**Headline:**
# Finally, energy that lasts past 2pm.

**Subhead:**
You're not lazy. You're not broken. You just haven't found what actually works for *your* energy. Summit helps you figure it out—with personalized habits, weekly reflection, and coaching support, all via text.

**CTA:** `Get Started`

## Problem Section

### Sound familiar?

- You've tried the morning routines. The supplements. The "just drink more water" advice.
- You start strong, then crash by Thursday.
- You know sleep matters, stress matters, movement matters—but you can't fix everything at once.
- Every productivity guru has a different answer. None of them know *your* life.

**The truth:** Energy isn't one habit. It's the *result* of several habits working together—sleep, stress, movement, even how you start your morning. And what works for someone else might not work for you.

**You don't need another generic checklist. You need to learn what actually moves the needle for *you*.**

## Solution Section

### A different approach to energy

Summit doesn't hand you a 10-step morning routine and wish you luck.

Instead, we help you:

1. **Get clear on what "more energy" actually means for you** — Not a vague goal, but a real vision you can feel.

2. **Start with 1-2 small habits that might matter** — AI suggests options based on your vision and life. You pick what feels doable.

3. **Reflect weekly on what's working** — Three simple questions. Five minutes. This is where the real learning happens.

4. **Adjust and try again** — No guilt, no streaks. Just data about *your* energy and *your* habits.

5. **Get support when you need it** — AI handles the daily nudges. A real coach steps in when you're stuck.

**All via text. No app to open. No dashboard to check.**

## The Multi-Behavioral Truth

### Energy isn't one thing

Most "energy" advice focuses on one lever—sleep OR exercise OR stress OR nutrition.

But you already know: **it's all connected.**

- Poor sleep → afternoon crash
- High stress → poor sleep
- No movement → low stress tolerance
- Skipped breakfast → energy rollercoaster

Summit helps you experiment across behaviors and see what *actually* affects your energy. Not theory. Your data. Your patterns. Your life.

**Start with one habit. Discover the connections. Build from there.**
