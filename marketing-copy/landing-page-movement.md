# Movement Landing Page (`/movement`)

## Hero Section

**Headline:**
# Build a movement habit that doesn't require becoming a gym person.

**Subhead:**
You know you should move more. But between work, life, and exhaustion, the gym feels impossible. Summit helps you find movement habits that actually fit your life—and stick.

**CTA:** `Get Started`

## Problem Section

### The fitness industry lied to you

- "Just start going to the gym" — With what time? What energy?
- "30 minutes a day" — Cool, that's 3.5 hours a week you don't have.
- Fitness apps track workouts you're not doing.
- You feel guilty every time you see your unused gym membership charge.

**The real problem:** Fitness culture is built for people who already exercise. If you're starting from zero—or restarting for the tenth time—you need a different approach.

**Movement doesn't have to mean "workout." It means moving your body more than you do now.**

---

## Solution Section

### A different approach to movement

Summit doesn't assume you want to become a CrossFit athlete.

Instead, we help you:

1. **Define what "more movement" means for you** — Not a fitness goal. A life goal. More energy? Less stiffness? Keep up with your kids? Get specific.

2. **Start embarrassingly small** — 5-minute walks. Stretching at your desk. Taking stairs once. Habits so small you can't fail.

3. **Reflect weekly on what's happening** — "I actually feel better on days I walk." "I hate morning workouts but evening ones work."

4. **Build gradually** — Once small habits stick, add more. No pressure. No timeline.

5. **Get support when motivation disappears** — AI nudges you on hard days. A real coach helps when you're stuck.

**All via text. No fitness app making you feel bad about yourself.**

## How It Works Section

### The Summit approach

```
Week 1: Define your movement vision
        ↓
        AI suggests tiny habits that might work
        (5-min walk, desk stretches, stairs, evening stroll)
        ↓
        You pick 1-2 to try this week
        ↓
Week 2: Reflect on what happened
        ↓
        Did you do it? How did it feel?
        ↓
        Keep, adjust, or try something different
        ↓
Repeat: Slowly build a movement practice that fits YOUR life
```

**This isn't a fitness program. It's a system for becoming someone who moves—at your own pace.**

## The Multi-Behavioral Truth

### Movement isn't just about exercise

Movement connects to everything else:

- **Better sleep** → More energy for movement
- **Less stress** → Movement feels like relief, not another chore
- **More energy** → Actually want to move instead of collapse on couch
- **Movement** → Better sleep, less stress, more energy → Positive cycle

Summit helps you see these connections. Sometimes the reason you're not moving isn't discipline—it's exhaustion from poor sleep or chronic stress.

**Fix the system, not just the symptom.**

## Movement Habits That Actually Work

These aren't gym workouts. These are real habits for real people:

- **5-minute morning walk** — Before coffee, before phone
- **Desk stretches** — 2 minutes, twice a day
- **Walking meetings** — Take calls on your feet
- **Stairs once a day** — Just once. That's it.
- **Evening stroll** — 10 minutes after dinner, no phone
- **Weekend "movement snack"** — A hike, bike ride, or just playing outside with kids

**You don't do all of these. You experiment with 1-2 and see what sticks.**

---
